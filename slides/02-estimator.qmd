# Do we have the right estimators to summarize our data and construct confidence intervals?

- [Sufficiency](#sufficiency)


## Sufficiency {#sufficiency}

Let $X_1,\dots,X_n$ have joint PMF/PDF $\varrho(\vx \mid \vtheta)$.

&nbsp;

A statistic $T(\vX)$ is [sufficient]{.alert} for $\vtheta$ if

the conditional distribution of $\vX$ given $T(\vX)$

does **NOT** depend on $\vtheta$.

&nbsp;

Interpretation:

> Once $T$ is known, the sample contains no additional information about $\vtheta$

## Factorization Theorem

$T(\vX)$ is [sufficient]{.alert} for $\vtheta$ iff

$$
\varrho(\vx \mid \vtheta)
=
g(T(\vx), \vtheta)\, h(\vx)
$$

where

-   $g$ depends on data only through $T$
-   $h$ does not depend on $\vtheta$

This is the fundamental practical tool for proving sufficiency
