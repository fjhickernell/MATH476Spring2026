# Hypothesis Testing Framework

- [Null hypothesis]{.alert} $H_0$ — the default assumption, often representing "no effect" or "status quo"
- [Alternative hypothesis]{.alert} $H_A$ — what we want to find evidence for
- [Test statistic]{.alert} $T(\vX)$ — a function of the data used to decide whether to reject $H_0$
- [Rejection region]{.alert} $\mathcal R$— the set of values of $T(\vX)$ for which we reject $H_0$
- [$p$-value]{.alert} — (under $H_0$) of a result at least as extreme as observed

We will use ideas from estimation, confidence intervals, and pivots to construct tests

## Errors

- Type I error: reject $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true
- Type II error: fail to reject $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true

## Rejection Region

Reject $H_0$ when $T(\vX) \in \mathcal R$

## p-values

$p$-value = probability (under $H_0$) of a result at least as extreme as observed

## Link to Confidence Intervals

Tests and CIs are two views of the same pivot idea

## Likelihood viewpoint (563 emphasis)

- Likelihood $L(\theta \mid \vx)$
- Likelihood ratio statistic

## Sufficiency link (563 emphasis)

If likelihood depends on data only through $T(\vX)$, then $T(\vX)$ is sufficient.

Tests depend only on sufficient statistics.
