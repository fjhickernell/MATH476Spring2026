# Statistics {data-state="goldborder"}

### Principled
- Clear assumptions
- Probability as a basis
- Efficient and accurate computation

### Inference about a population
- Want to know parameters that describe a large number or individuals or the relationships among them
- Should provide a level of uncertainty

### From Data
- Carefully sampled
- Observations, surveys, experiments, or computer simulations

# Examples
- Approval ratings
- Numerical integration (quadrature)

## Approval ratings

The Gallup Poll tracks the [approval ratings of US presidents](https://news.gallup.com/poll/203198/presidential-approval-ratings-donald-trump.aspx) according to a [careful polling methodology](https://www.gallup.com/224855/gallup-poll-work.aspx)

Each day they telephone $n=1500$ adults and their sampling error for the approval ratings is about $4\%$

Let $Y \sim \Ber(\mu)$, i.e., a [Bernoulli]{.alert} (coin-flipping) distribution wth probability  of success $\mu$, 
\begin{align*}
\Prob(Y =y) = \begin{cases} \mu, & y=1, \text{ (yes)}\\
1-\mu, & y = 0, \text{ (no)}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}


# MATH 476 — Statistics 

Welcome to **MATH 476**.

\noindent This course introduces probability and statistics with an emphasis on
modeling and data and not running over the margins.

# Basic Probability Notation 

- Sample space: $\Omega$
- Event: $A \subseteq \Omega$
- Probability of $A$: $\Prob(A)$
- Complement: $A^{c}$
- Conditional probability:
  $$
    \Prob(A \mid B) = \frac{\Prob(A \cap B)}{\Prob(B)}, \qquad \Prob(B) > 0
  $$
- Expectation $\Ex[Y]=$

[Key idea: probabilities are always between $0$ and $1$.]{.alert}


## More probability

You need to know expectation, mean, etc. with a h2 header

\begin{gather*}
\var(Y) = \operatorname{var}(Y) \\
\DeclareMathOperator{\var}{var}
\var(Y) = \operatorname{var}(Y) \\
\Ex[Y] = \Ex[f(X)], Y \in \reals \\
\end{gather*}

### Random variables

an h3 header

## {.headerless}

and even more on this slide without the header

# Example Slide With Alerts 

- Plain text is dark gray.
- [Alerted term]{.alert} stands out in blue.
- You can also color math: [ $\Pr(A \mid B)$ ]{.alert}


# Python Test Slide 

This slide verifies that Python runs inside your Quarto RevealJS slides.

```{python}
#| echo: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 4*np.pi, 400)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sine Wave Test")
plt.show()
```

## Code that does not show
```{python}
#| results: asis
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print(rf"$\pi = {np.pi}$")
```

## Interactive Plot (Plotly) 

This slide tests interactive graphics.

```{python}
#| echo: true

import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 200)
y = np.sin(x)

px.line(x=x, y=y, title="Interactive Sine Wave")
```

# A small R example

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

# Simulate data
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)

# Basic summaries
mean(x)
sd(x)

# Simple plot
hist(x, col = "steelblue", main = "Histogram of x")
```

That’s it.
